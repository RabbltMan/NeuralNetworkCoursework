> This repository served its purpose during the very specific period of Neural Network Design Coursework in October, 2023. It will no longer be actively developed or maintained, for I have finished my report and there must be much better solutions for these tasks elsewhere, especially for [`Facial Recognition`](https://github.com/RabbltMan/NeuralNetworkCoursework/tree/master/FacialRecognition).
