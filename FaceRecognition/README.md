# Face recognition

Face recognition is currently one of the most successful applications of deep learning in practice. In the field of computer vision, face recognition has always been a popular research direction. Today, face recognition is widely used in various domains such as payment systems, attendance tracking, judicial systems, factories, education, and more. 

The concept of face recognition refers to the process of identifying and locating human faces in videos or images.

The task of face recognition can be divided into `2 stages`: **detection** and **recognition**. 
- In the first stage, face detection should be performed to locate faces in videos or images. 
- In the second stage, the detected faces are compared with a database of facial features to identify the target person.
